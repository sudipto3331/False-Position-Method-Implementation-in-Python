# False-Position-Method-Implementation-in-Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of the False Position Method, also known as the Regula Falsi Method, for finding roots of nonlinear equations. Additionally, the script compares the performance of the False Position Method with the Bisection Method, saving results in an Excel file (`LAB2.xls`).
